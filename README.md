# Hello World 💫  

I'm **Ruhi**, a tech newbie who is interested in understanding the workings behind the screen.  
I am currently working on building my foundation layer by layer – learning, experimenting, and developing through small projects.
Apart from tech, I am a person who is interested in self-improvement and having meaningful conversations.  
Learning new languages (Japanese 🇯🇵 at the moment), developing creative ideas, and self-improvement are some of my interests.

### My Approach  
I believe in consistency over perfection.  
I focus on understanding concepts deeply and improving a little every day.
